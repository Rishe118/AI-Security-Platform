# Pitch Summary

## What Is the Idea?
A platform that:
- Predicts future software vulnerabilities using AI
- Auto-generates patches
- Tests patches in a cloned environment
- Simulates attacker behavior to validate (controlled API)

## Why It Matters
- 80% of breaches come from known but unpatched vulnerabilities
- We shift from reactive to proactive cybersecurity

## What Makes It Unique
- Prediction + patching + testing + validation in one workflow
- Developer-friendly and CI/CD ready
- AI-powered red teaming simulation
- Supply chain risk prediction
- Responsible hybrid licensing for safe use

## Ask
Mentors, sponsors, and pilot collaborators welcome.
