# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We actively support the most recent development version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue or misuse vector:
- Please **DO NOT create a public issue**.
- Email us immediately at [kale.rishe118@gmail.com]
- We aim to respond within 48 hours and resolve valid reports ASAP.

## Responsible Use Notice
This project includes components like:
- AI-based red teaming simulation
- Patch validation and test environments

To avoid misuse, the most sensitive features (like red teaming) are only available via a **rate-limited, cloud-hosted API** with abuse protection.

We encourage ethical use only. Contributions promoting misuse will be rejected.
