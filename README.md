# AI-Driven Vulnerability Prediction & Proactive Patching Platform 🚀

Proactively predict, patch, simulate, and validate vulnerabilities before they cause damage — responsibly.

## 🔍 Features
- Predict vulnerabilities in source code & dependencies
- Auto-generate patches for known weak patterns
- Simulate patches in a digital clone
- Validate with AI-based red team attacks (controlled via hosted API)

## 🔐 Responsible Use
We believe in ethical AI. Our core tools are open-source, but sensitive components like red teaming and predictive engines are hosted with API access control. This protects against misuse and aligns with our mission of responsible cybersecurity.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation & project summary
- `prototype/`: Python code for scanner, patcher, simulator
- `pitch_deck/`: Investor/mentor presentation
- `assets/`: Images, diagrams, and logos

## 📈 Roadmap (First 6 Weeks)
- ✅ Build CVE detection and vulnerability scanner using Bandit + custom rules
- ✅ Match scan results with real-time CVEs and provide output in `.txt`/`.json`
- 🧪 Develop Docker-based patch testbed and simulate code post-patch (Week 3)
- 🔐 Integrate AI red team simulation engine via API (Week 4–5)
- 🔗 Build GitHub CI/CD plugin with patch PR and scoring (Week 5)
- 🧪 Beta test MVP on open-source repos and gather feedback (Week 6)
